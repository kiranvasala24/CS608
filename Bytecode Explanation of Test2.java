Explanation of Test2.java Bytecode commands:

ILOAD (Load Integer):

Opcode: ILOAD index
Loads an integer value from a local variable onto the stack.
Example: ILOAD 1 loads the value of the local variable at index 1 onto the stack.
IINC (Increment Integer):

Opcode: IINC index const
Increments the value of a local variable by a constant value.
Example: IINC 1 1 increments the value of the local variable at index 1 by 1.
GOTO (Branch Unconditionally):

Opcode: GOTO target
Performs an unconditional branch to the target instruction.
Example: GOTO L3 jumps to the instruction labeled L3.
Explanation of bytecode flow:

The method starts by initializing local variables i and sum to 0 (instructions 5-9).
The loop begins at L2 and continues until i is greater than n (instructions 11-28).
The loop body increments the sum by the current value of i (instructions 18-21).
After each iteration, i is incremented by 1 (instruction 24).
The loop condition checks whether i is less than or equal to n, and if true, it jumps to L4 (instructions 28-29).
The method returns the final sum (instructions 32-33).
